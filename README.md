## 🎮 **How to Use**
1. **Select Company Size:** Choose the appropriate size for your company (Small, Medium, or Large).
2. **Choose Cybersecurity Measures:** Select the cybersecurity measures your company has in place (Firewall, Data Sensitivity, Encryption, Incident Response Plan).  You can select multiple measures.
3. **Click "Calculate Risk":**  Once you've made your selections, click the "Calculate Risk" button.
4. **Get a Risk Score & Estimated Insurance Premium:**  The platform will calculate your risk score and provide an estimated insurance premium based on your inputs.
5. **AI-Powered Risk Prediction Improves Accuracy:**  The platform uses AI-powered risk prediction to continuously improve the accuracy of risk assessments over time.

**🧪 AI-Based Risk Prediction**

The tool now incorporates AI-based risk assessment using a Decision Tree model. The model is trained on cybersecurity-related factors and helps provide more accurate risk scores and premium estimates.

**How it Works**

1. **Train the AI Model** using train_model.py.   
2. **Risk factors** like company size, firewall, data sensitivity, incident response, and encryption are used as inputs.     
3. **The AI model predicts the risk score**, helping generate better premium calculations.     
4. The model is **continuously improvable** with more data.
